# lgbtqAnalysisPackage
My repository for my R Programming Final Project about 2016 LGBTQ+ Rights in the U.S.

This is a package to analyze data from the attached data folder which contains the csv file 'equality_index'. This file has 6 variables that are worthy of investigation, which the functions of the package clean, analyze and visualize. These functions include: 'import_data()' which reads in a csv file, 'clean()' which cleans the given csv file, 'summarize_by_region' which summarizes all variables categorized into regions and uses the '.mode' in order to find the mode of one variable (historical affiliation), 'plot_gop' which plots out GOP voter percentage of states by amount of LGBTQ+ rights laws of the state, 'plot_urban' which plots out urban population percentage of states by amount of LGBTQ+ rights laws of the state, and lastly'plot_state' which creates a box plot ranking the top 25 states by LGBTQ+ laws.
